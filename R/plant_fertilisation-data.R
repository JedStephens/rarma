#' @docType data
#' @description Measurements of the heights (in cm.) of different cross-fertilised and self-fertilised
#'  Zea mays (maize) plants in an experiment conducted by Darwin.
#'  Darwin details the experimental design on pages 11 to 15.
#'  The measurements appear orginally in inches (Darwin, 1878: 16)
#'  and are converted to centimetre and then rounded to one decimal place.
#' @format A data frame with fifteen observations on two variables
#' @details  Zea mays (maize) plant height in an experiment conducted by Darwin on
